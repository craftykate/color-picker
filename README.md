# Color Picker

A sweet little tool for finding several different color combinations - complimentary, split complimentary, triad, analogous and square combinations.

See it live at [kates-color-picker.surge.sh](http://kates-color-picker.surge.sh/)

## Background

I like seeing color combinations while I'm planning a new project - whether it's a new site, a knitted item, or paint colors for the house. So I built a little tool in React that lets you pick a color and it calculates various color combinations.

## Features

This site uses React Color for the color picker. Slide it around to find your starting color and the site automatically updates the other colors. Hover over a color to see (and be able to copy) the hex and rgb codes. Click a new color and that color will become the main color.

## To do

~~I'm contemplating add a feature where you can save a color combination. But this was not bad for one day's work!~~
